# tinyrenderer-canvas

This is an exploration of the tinyrenderer project, but using the HTML5 canvas
for displaying the results.

The rest of the work I just copied off of
https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki -- and hopefully by the end of the
project, I now have reviewed my geometry subjects from 15 years ago.
